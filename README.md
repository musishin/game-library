# Game Library

### <a href="https://mygamelibrary.net">Live Demo!</a>

This is a webapp that allows you to record and keep track of your video game library. For each game it will allow you to input information including:

1. Title
2. Genre
3. Platform
4. Status of the game in relation to the user's progress of it
5. Hours played
6. Date started
7. Date completed

The games listed can be filtered based on the status of the game in the library. The search function allows further narrowing down of the list as well.

This webapp is built for both desktop and mobile browsers.


## Google Firebase

Currently, the webapp is using Google Firebase services for authentication and storing the user's library with the realtime database. The user will log in with their Google account and the corresponding game list with that account will be displayed.


## Current Features

Currently, the app allows basic storing of games and displaying of information in relation to the progress of completion for each game. There is also statistics at the bottom of the list that shows the current total hours for completed games and total number of games for each category. The user is also able to delete and edit games in the list.


## Important New Takeaways

1. Usage of data attributes to keep track of elements during DOM manipulation.
2. Usage of objects
3. Usage of object prototype to create single functions for every instance of the object created
4. Usage of Firebase in code to hold user data and retrieve and store them when necessary
